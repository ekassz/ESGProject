# ESGProject 
### Shiny App: [https://ekass.shinyapps.io/ESG-Visual/](https://ekass.shinyapps.io/ESGApp/)
##### ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance, and our focus is a subset of financial investors who aim to invest in not only successful, but also equitable and sustainable companies.
Goal: Create an interface for hypothetical ESG investors from diverse backgrounds, specifically those interested in clean energy companies. This modality allows us to identify and create an extensive list of issues and topics that need to be investigated, enabling us to understand the broader context of investment problems and collaborate in providing effective solutions.

Focus: Plot the ESG ratings using a combination of bar charts, heatmaps, and radar charts to appeal to investors with a diverse array of experience.

### Dataset We Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alistairking/public-company-esg-ratings-dataset 
We found a dataset named Corporate Environmental Impact which contains corporate sustainability data that showcases each firm’s environmental impact, as well as a similar dataset named Public Company ESG Ratings which contains pre-existing ESG ratings for public companies. The former focuses on three monetarily based compositions of economic impact as well as eight more columns of “safeguard subjects,” which are ratings related to a certain sector of sustainability. Each of these eight columns contains multiple values in a list and will need to be separated so that the data is tidy and usable. The latter contains sustainability ratings of A, B, BB, and BBB relating to both the environmental and social sectors of ESG.

### Dashboard I worked on (ESG Performance Insights) :
Purpose: Interactive dashboard for users to filter by ESG sectors. While also selecting different grades:
<br />
High (AAA, AA, A)
<br />
Medium (BBB, BB, B)
<br />
Low (CCC, C)
<br />
<br />
Interactive Features:
<br />
1. Dropdown menu to select grades for each sector, and selecting an ESG score type.
2. Having a bin width slider input to see a broader or more detailed distribution of ESG scores.
3. Having a search bar in the data table that takes input and highlights it in the graph as ‘Searched Companies’. 
<br />
Insights:
<br />
Most companies shown seem to fall either right at the B Grade Minimum (200 score) or right at the A Grade Minimum (500 score). 
Grades can provide a quick overview of how a company is doing, while scores give specific information.
